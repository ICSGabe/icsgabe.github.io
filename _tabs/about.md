## **Purpose of Site**

My name is **Gabriel Agboruche** and I'm a father, husband, an electrical engineer, a lover brass band music, and an OT Cybersecurity Leader. Welcome to my corner of the cybersecurity world! With years of experience in Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity, I've navigated through complex challenges and amassed a wealth of knowledge and insights. This blog is my platform to share those experiences and lessons with you.

  

Here, you'll find a blend of technical and non-technical content, tailored for both newcomers and seasoned practitioners in the cybersecurity field. My focus? To demystify intricate concepts in OT security, making them accessible and engaging to wider audience. Whether it's deep technical dives or broader industry discussions, the goal is to enrich your understanding and spark curiosity.

  

I believe in the power of shared knowledge. This blog isn't just about my journey; it's a resource for the community. Expect candid reflections on my ongoing learning journey and the hurdles I encounter. It's a real, unfiltered look at the ever-evolving OT cybersecurity landscape.

  

Ultimately, my mission is to empower organizations and individuals. By breaking down complex cybersecurity topics, I aim to arm you with the information needed to navigate and counter today's cyber threats effectively.

  

Join me in this endeavor to enhance our collective cybersecurity resilience.

### **Active Projects**

  

My new journey as a cybersecurity-focused developer has led me to contribute and create various projects. Here are a few that I'm actively developing:

  

- **[Cyber_Security_Interview_Questions](https://github.com/ICSGabe/Cyber_Security_Interview_Questions):** A curated list of interview questions from actual security professionals, aimed at helping candidates prepare for cybersecurity roles.

  

- **[chatty](https://github.com/ICSGabe/chatty):** A Python utility that sifts through pcap data to highlight the most significant bit transfers, and outputs insights into a text document.

  

- **[IPThreatAnalyzer_from_pcap](https://github.com/ICSGabe/IPThreatAnalyzer_from_pcap):** This tool leverages Python to analyze pcap files, identify public IP addresses and domains, and cross-reference them with security threat databases like Virus Total and AlienVault.


- **[arp_scan](https://github.com/ICSGabe/arp_scan):** A Python script that uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) protocol to discover devices on your local network and identify their manufacturers.
  

- **[pcap_to_geolocation](https://github.com/ICSGabe/pcap_to_geolocation):** This script transforms pcap file data into geolocation information, outputting the results into a readable text format.
